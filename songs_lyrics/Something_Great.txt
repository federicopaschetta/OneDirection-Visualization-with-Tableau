Something Great
[Intro: All]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Liam, Zayn]
One day, you'll come into my world and say it all
You'll say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day, you'll say these words I've thought, but never said
You'll say we're better off together in our bed

[Chorus: Harry, All]
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imaginin' (Oh)
Come on, jump out at me (Oh-oh)
Come on, bring everything (Oh)
Is it too much to ask for something great? (Oh)

[Verse 2: Niall, Harry]
The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day, I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight

[Chorus: Harry, All]
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imaginin' (Oh)
Come on, jump out at me (Oh-oh)
Come on, bring everything (Oh)
Is it too much to ask for something great? (Oh)

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Zayn, All, Harry & Zayn]
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imaginin' (Oh)
Oh, come on, jump out at me (Oh-oh)
Come on, bring everything (Oh)
Is it too much to ask for something great? (Oh)
I want you here with me (Oh)
Like how I pictured it (Oh)
Is it too much to ask for something great? (Oh)

[Outro: Louis]
You're all I want
So much it's hurtin'
You're all I want
So much it's hurtin'
