Loved You First
[Verse 1: Zayn, Liam]
Girl, it should be me driving to your house
Knockin' on your door and kissing you on the mouth
Holdin' on your hand, dancin' in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart because

[Chorus: All, Harry]
I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first

[Verse 2: Louis, Harry]
Girl, it should be me callin' on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time lookin' in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart because
You might also like[Chorus: All, Harry]
I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first

[Bridge: Zayn]
First touch, the first kiss
First girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak, it's killing me
I loved you first, why can't you see?

[Breakdown: Niall, Zayn]
I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry & Zayn]
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin' (Coulda been where he is)
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first

[Outro: Zayn, Zayn & Harry]
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah
Baby I loved you first
