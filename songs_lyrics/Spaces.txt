Spaces
[Verse 1: Niall, Louis]
Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn, All]
We keep taking turns (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Will we ever learn?

[Chorus: All, Niall]
Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Bye

[Verse 2: Liam, Louis & Liam]
Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made

[Chorus: All, Liam]
Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Bye

When will we learn?

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Bye

[Post-Chorus: Harry, All, Niall]
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
The spaces between us

[Outro: Niall]
The spaces between us
