Change My Mind
[Verse 1: Louis]
The end of the night, we should say goodbye
But we carry on while everyone's gone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

[Chorus: Liam]
But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind

[Verse 2: Liam]
Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs
There's no music on, but we dance along

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure
You might also like[Chorus: Zayn]
But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind

[Post-Chorus: Zayn]
I'll change my mind

[Bridge: Niall]
Baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

[Chorus: Harry, Zayn]
But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind
