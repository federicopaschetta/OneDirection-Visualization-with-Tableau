Drag Me Down (Big Payno x AFTERHRS Remix)
[Intro: Lunchmoney Lewis]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Lunchmomey Lewis]
Ever since you came around (Yeah)
Everybody wanna drag us down (Yeah)
Is it 'cause we look too happy? (Ah, yeah)
I'll never forget when you looked at me
And told me it was all mine
I remember that like yesterday
It was a summer night on the West Side
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah
We crossed paths like an intersection (Yeah)
Now we both headed in one direction

[Chorus: Liam & Niall]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
​Nobody can drag me down​
Nobody can drag me–

I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and, baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

[Chorus: Niall]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
​Nobody can drag me down​
Nobody can drag–

[Verse 3: Lunchmoney Lewis]
She a work of art like Van Gogh
I'm underground like Camp Lo (Woah)
Yeah, I'm top of them pop charts but I'm still saggin' my pants low
I don't do meetings, I cancel (Ayy)
One D let me get some of them fans though
Just a young nigga from Dade County
Where they move chickens like Nando (Ooh)
Woo, when I touch down in London town (Ah, yeah)
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down (Shut down, shut down)
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down
[Chorus: Liam, Niall, Harry & Niall]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
​Nobody can drag me down​
Nobody can drag me down​
