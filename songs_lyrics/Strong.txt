Strong
[Verse 1: Zayn, Liam]
My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait till it's gone
You make me strong

[Chorus: All & Harry]
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

[Verse 2: Louis]
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

[Chorus: All]
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from fallin' apart
I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong

[Chorus: Niall, All, Harry]
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
