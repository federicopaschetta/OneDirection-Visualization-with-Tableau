Little Black Dress
[Verse 1: Louis & Harry]
Little black dress just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn, can't stop looking at you
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right, you know
Little black dress, did you come here alone?
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know

[Chorus: All]
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me (Ow)

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry]
Little black dress, who you doin' it for?
Little black dress, I can't take any more
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right, you know
Little black dress, what's your favorite song?
Little black dress, I won't do you no harm
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know
It's alright, it's alright 'cause I'll take you home

[Chorus: All]
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me
