Gotta Be You
[Verse 1: Liam]
Girl, I see it in your eyes, you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl, what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am, asking you for one more chance

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Can we fall one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh, and if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

[Chorus: Harry, All]
It's gotta be you, only you
It's got to be you, oh, only you
Hey

[Verse 2: Liam, Liam & Zayn]
Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me, I don't resemble who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
But don't be scared, I ain't goin' nowhere

I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more cryin'
But if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

[Chorus: Harry, All]
It's gotta be you, only you
It's got to be you, oh, only you

[Bridge: Zayn, All]
Oh, girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time, I'll make it better
(One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more, can we try?)
Can we try one more time and make it all better?

[Chorus: Harry, All]
'Cause it's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Oh, only you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
It's got to be you, oh, only you
