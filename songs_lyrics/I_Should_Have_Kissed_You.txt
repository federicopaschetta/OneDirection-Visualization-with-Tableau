I Should Have Kissed You
[Verse 1: Liam, Harry, Liam & Harry]
I keep playin' it inside my head, all that you said to me
I lie awake, just to convince myself this wasn't just a dream
'Cause you were right here and I should've taken the chance
But I got so scared and I lost the moment again
It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about

[Chorus: All]
Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I shoulda kissed you

[Post-Chorus: All]
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you

[Verse 2: Liam, Zayn, Louis & Zayn]
Every morning when I leave my house, I always look for you, yeah
I see you every time I close my eyes, what am I gonna do?
And all my friends say that I'm punchin' over my weight
But in your eyes, I saw how you were looking at me
It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I shoulda kissed you

[Post-Chorus: All]
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you

[Bridge: Zayn, Liam]
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away
When we were dancin' and you looked up at me
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way
If I could replay, I would've never have let you go
No, woah, never have let you go
Am I out of time?

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
Is your heart taken? (Yeah) Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? (Breaking, yeah, ooh) How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I shoulda kissed you (Oh)
[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn]
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you (Oh)
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you (Yeah, oh)
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda kissed you
