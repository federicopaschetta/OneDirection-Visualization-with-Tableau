C’mon, C’mon
[Intro: Harry, Liam]
C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Zayn]
The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone

[Pre-Chorus: Liam, Louis, Harry]
So, c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
Ain't no way you're walking out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

[Chorus: All]
Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"
Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

[Verse 2: Niall, Zayn, Liam]
The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Liam, Louis, Harry]
So, c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
Ain't no way you're walking out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

[Chorus: All]
Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"
Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

[Bridge: Harry]
And every step I take, I feel it more and more
She's calling out, she's a lucky girl
My heart is racing, she's turning around
I reach for her hand and I say

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Hey, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"
Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby
[Outro: Zayn, Harry, Liam, All]
Yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)
C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)
C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby
