Still the One
[Verse 1: Liam, Louis]
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while, but, baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
And yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're lookin' at me unsure
I shoulda seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

[Chorus: All, Harry]
I was so stupid for lettin' you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on, but, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much, but I will never give up
I was so stupid for lettin' you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one

[Verse 2: Niall, Harry & Niall]
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl, just tell me what I wanna hear
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said, yeah
I can't get it out of my head
