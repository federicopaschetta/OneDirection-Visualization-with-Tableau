Diana

[Verse 1: Liam, All, Harry]
The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)
I never would mistreat ya, no, I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call

[Chorus: All]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realise
Baby, you'd be saving mine

[Post-Chorus: Zayn]
Oh-oh
Diana

[Verse 2: Niall, All, Louis]
It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)
I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language, but I still hear you call
You might also like[Chorus: All]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realise
Baby, you'd be saving mine

[Bridge: Harry]
We all need somethin'
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
Swear I'd never put you down

[Chorus: All]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realise
Baby, you'd be saving mine
[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry]

Baby, you'd be savin' mine
(Oh-oh-oh) Diana
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Diana
Baby, you'd be savin' mine
