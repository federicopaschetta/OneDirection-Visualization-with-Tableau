Change Your Ticket
[Intro]
Don't go
Don't go

[Verse 1: Harry]
Watchin' you get dressed messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come, get back in bed, we've still got time left
This don't have to be over

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
And you say, "It's hard to keep a secret"
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I'll promise that I'll never tell

[Chorus: Liam, All]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh-oh
You should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
So, you should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home

Don't play innocent, I know what you meant
When you said you'd come over
Aren't we way past that, playin' hard to get?
We did that when we were younger

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And you say, "It's hard to keep a secret"
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I'll promise that I'll never tell

[Chorus: Liam, Harry, All]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh-oh
You should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home (Come on, let me change your ticket)
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone (Oh!)
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh-oh

[Bridge: Zayn]
Why don't we take some time?
Why don't we take just a little more time?
Why don't we make it right?
Girl, I don't wanna say goodbye
[Chorus: Liam, Harry & Liam, Harry, All]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh-oh
You should probably stay (Yeah), be with me a couple more days (A couple more days)
Come on, let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
Don't go (Don't go), it's not the same when you're gone
Come on, let me change your ticket home
