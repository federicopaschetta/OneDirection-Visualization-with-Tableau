Walking in the Wind
[Verse 1: Harry]
A week ago, you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far?"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we?
Ah-ooh, we had some good tricks up our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

[Chorus: All]
And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

[Verse 2: Louis]
Yesterday, I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we?
Ah-ooh, we wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

[Chorus: All]
And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

[Bridge: Harry]
And I know we'll be alright, child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: All, Harry]
And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me (Me)
In places that we've never been (Never been)
For reasons we don't understand (Understand)
Walking in the wind (Wind)
Walking in the wind (Walking in the wind)
Walking in the wind
