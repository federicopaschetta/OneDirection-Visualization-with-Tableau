Act My Age
[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Niall, Liam]
When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause I move a little slow when I dance
I can count on you after all that we've been through
'Cause I know that you'll always understand

[Chorus: All]
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
Hey!

[Verse 2: Louis, Zayn]
When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause the stories that I told, I tell again and again
I can count on you after all we got up to
'Cause I know that you truly understand

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age (Act my age, no, I'll—)
No, I'll still feel the same, you will, too
Hey!

When I can hardly walk and my hair is fallin' out
We'll still stay up till mornin', we'll throw the after-party
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age (Act my age, no, I'll—)
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age (Act my age, no, I'll—)
No, I'll still feel the same, you will, too
Hey!
