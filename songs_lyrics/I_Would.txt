I Would
[Verse 1: Liam, Harry]
Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam, Louis]
Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying "Kick me"
Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got twenty-seven tattoos
You might also like[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would

[Post-Chorus: All]
I would, I would

[Bridge: Louis, Zayn]
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would? (I would)
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

[Breakdown: Harry]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
[Outro: Louis, Zayn, All]
Would he please you? (Would he please you?)
Would he kiss you? (Would he kiss you?)
Would he treat you like I would? (Like I would)
Would he touch you? (Would he touch you?)
Would he need you? (Would he need you?)
Would he love you like I would? (Like I would)
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me then I would, I would (Like I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
I would (Yeah), I would (Yeah)
