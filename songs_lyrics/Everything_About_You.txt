Everything About You
[Verse 1: Liam, Harry]
You know I've always got your back, girl
So let me be the one you come running to, running to, ru—, ru—, runnin'
I see it's just a matter of fact, girl, you just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep comin'
On the other side of the world, it don't matter
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

[Chorus: All, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

[Post-Chorus: All, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it, but don't realise that it's my-my lovin'
There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing
Every minute's like the last, so let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-tickin'
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me (Kiss on me)
It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

[Post-Chorus: All, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you
[Bridge: Zayn]
And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know, without you, I can't face it
All we wanna have is fun, but they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

[Chorus: All, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby (The way that we touch, baby)
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)
Everything that you do, do, do
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

[Post-Chorus: All, Liam]
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you
