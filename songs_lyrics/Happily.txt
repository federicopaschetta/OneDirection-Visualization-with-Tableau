Happily
[Verse 1: Harry]
You don't understand, you don't understand (Yeah)
What you do to me when you hold his hand (Hey)
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate (Yeah)
Made it so we had to walk away (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Niall, Zayn]
'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now
(One, two, three)

[Chorus: All, Harry]
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one
Who'll hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave, so c'mon
Baby, be with me so happily

[Verse 2: Liam, Louis, All]
(Hey) It's 4AM and I know that you're with him
(Yeah) I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
(Hey) And if he feels my traces in your hair
(Yeah) I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care
