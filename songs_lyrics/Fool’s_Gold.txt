Foolâ€™s Gold
[Verse 1: Niall]
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

[Chorus: Harry, All]
And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

[Verse 2: Liam]
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part
You might also like[Chorus: All, Harry]
And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold
Oh

[Bridge: Zayn]
Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

[Chorus: All]
And, yes, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

[Outro: Harry]
Oh
Oh
Oh, hmm
