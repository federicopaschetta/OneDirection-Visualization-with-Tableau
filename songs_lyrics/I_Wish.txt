I Wish
[Intro: Liam]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Zayn, Liam]
He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that? (Na-na-na-na-na)
When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
But I see you, with him, slow dancin'
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'
Oh, how I wish that was me

[Interlude: Liam]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

He looks at you the way that I would
Does all the things I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

[Pre-Chorus: Harry & Zayn]
'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you

[Chorus: All, Harry]
But I see you, with him, slow dancin'
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'
Oh, how I wish that was me

[Bridge: Harry, Harry & Zayn]
With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you'll call later on
'Cause you wanna say goodnight

[Breakdown: Liam & Zayn]
'Cause I see you, with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

[Chorus: All, Harry, Zayn]
But I see you, with him, slow dancin'
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'
Oh, how I wish, oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish that was me
[Outro: Zayn]
Oh, how I wish that was me
