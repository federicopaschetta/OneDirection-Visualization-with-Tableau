Heart Attack
[Verse 1: Harry]
Baby, you got me sick, I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
Got your voice in my head saying, "Let's just be friends"
Can't believe the words came outta your mouth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right

[Chorus: Harry, Niall, All]
And I'm, like, (Ow!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And (Ow!)
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one
It's (Ow!) giving me a heart attack
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Liam, Niall]
Yeah, baby, now that you're gone, I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinkin' about, yeah
Everyone's telling me, I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right
