Already Home
[Verse 1]
I’ve been waiting, every day since
The last time we met, I can’t forget what we parted ways with
I see your face and
Can’t stop looking
I swear that these words haven’t been heard
In the way I mean them

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this really happening?
This is really happening
Can this keep on happening?

[Chorus]
Together we’re alone, both of us agreeing
No one needs to know, that you’re already home
You don’t have to go, but you’re already leaving
Can we start believing? You’re alrеady homе
You don’t have to go, 'cause you’rе already homе

[Verse
