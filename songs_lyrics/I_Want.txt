I Want
[Verse 1: Harry]
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard the girls say

[Chorus: All, Louis]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

[Verse 2: Liam]
You've got everythin' you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say
You might also like[Chorus: All, Niall, Louis, Zayn]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
Oh, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

[Bridge: Zayn]
Be loved by you, I wanna
I'll stay true, I wanna
If you knew what you put me through
Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too?

[Instrumental Break]

[Breakdown: Liam, Zayn]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I wanna be loved by you
(Oh, and all the girls say)

[Chorus: All, Louis, Niall, Harry, *Zayn*]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
I want, I want, I want (And all the girls say)
I want, I want, I want (*And that's crazy*)
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
