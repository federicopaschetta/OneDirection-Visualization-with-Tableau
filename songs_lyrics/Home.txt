Home
[Verse 1: Liam, Niall]
Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh-oh)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh-oh)
Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All, Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
So hot that I couldn't take it
Wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling
I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh-oh)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh-oh)
Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All, Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

[Bridge: Louis, Harry]
I'll make this feel like home
Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All, Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
