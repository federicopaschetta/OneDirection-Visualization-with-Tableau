Once in a Lifetime
[Verse 1: Liam]
Once in a lifetime, it's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even a landslide or riptide
Could take it all away

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

[Chorus: All]
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
Once in a lifetime, it's just right
And we are always safe
Not even the bad guys in the dark night
Could take it all away

[Pre-Chorus: All, Louis, Niall]
(Ooh) Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
(Ooh) Out loud, someone's calling my name
And it sounds like you
You might also like[Chorus: All]
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

[Bridge: Zayn, All]
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side

[Outro: Liam]
Once in a lifetime, you were mine
