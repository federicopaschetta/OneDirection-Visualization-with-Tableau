Better Than Words
[Intro: Liam]
Ooh

[Verse 1: Harry, Liam]
Better than words
More than a feeling (Ow)
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling (Ha)
Every time we touch, I'm all shook up
You make me wanna, how deep is your love?
God only knows, baby

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
(Ooh) I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
(Ooh) There's no way I can explain your love, no
(Ah-ooh) I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
(Ooh) I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words

[Post-Chorus: Niall, Harry, Liam]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Better than words
(Oh-oh-oh)
