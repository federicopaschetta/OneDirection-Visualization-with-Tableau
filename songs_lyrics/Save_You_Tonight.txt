Save You Tonight
[Intro: All]
I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh

[Verse 1: Liam]
It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes, but they stay closed, closed

[Chorus: All, Niall]
I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

[Verse 2: Zayn]
Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
'Cause he don't adore ya
To him, you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
What you want, what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears

[Chorus: All, Niall]
I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

[Bridge: Louis]
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Niall]
I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman (Oh)
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
[Outro: All, Niall]
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
