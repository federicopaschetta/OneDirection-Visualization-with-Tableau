No Control
[Intro: Louis, All]
Oh
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Niall, Harry, All]
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

[Post-Chorus: All, Louis]
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Liam, Harry, All]
Taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day
You might also like[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

[Bridge: Zayn]
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours

[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

[Outro: Louis]
Oh
No control
Oh
No control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
