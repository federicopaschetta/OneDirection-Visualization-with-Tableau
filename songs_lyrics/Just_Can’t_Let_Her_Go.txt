Just Canâ€™t Let Her Go
[Zayn]
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All]
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go

[Verse: Harry Styles and Zayn Malik]
Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind, yeah, oh oh oh
I want her everybody wants her
She knows it, ay ay ay
I want her, but I better run away
Oh oh oh

She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go
