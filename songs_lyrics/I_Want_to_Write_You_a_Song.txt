I Want to Write You a Song
[Verse 1: Harry, Liam]
I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

[Chorus: Louis, Louis & Liam]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do

[Verse 2: Liam]
I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think
That your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

[Chorus: Louis, Louis & Liam]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

[Chorus: Harry, Harry & Liam]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

[Outro: Niall]
I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song
