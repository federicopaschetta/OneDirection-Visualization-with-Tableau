Illusion
[Intro: All]
Tell me you believe in love
It's not an illusion
Yeah

[Verse 1: Liam]
I've been thinking 'bout the nights and the dangerous tricks
People play on the eyes of the innocent (Yeah)
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But believe me (Yeah)
I'm not trying to deceive ya (Yeah)
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake

[Chorus: All]
No, baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve (Yeah)
Oh, baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No, baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

'Bout how the cards fall, I'm all that you need tonight (Yeah)
I would never turn your heart into broken parts

Can't you see it? (Yeah)
I'm not trying to mislead ya (Yeah)
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake

[Chorus: All, Harry]
No, baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve (Yeah)

[Bridge: Niall]
You can tie me up in chains, you can throw away the key
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave
You're the truth I can't explain, you're the only one I see
It's not an illusion to me
[Chorus: All, Zayn]
