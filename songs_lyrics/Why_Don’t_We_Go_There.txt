Why Donâ€™t We Go There?
[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
I know you want, know you wanna take it slow
Think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight, just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key

[Chorus: Zayn Malik]
'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride out in the cold air
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?

[Post-Chorus: Liam Payne]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
Say the word, say the word, but don't say no
Skydive, you and I with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me, there's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see we'd do it anyway

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
'Cause we got all night, we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride out in the cold air
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?

[Bridge: Niall Horan]
Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say no, just let go

[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson, All, Niall Horan, & Harry Styles]
'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride (Let's take a ride) out in the cold air
I know the way (I know the way), why don't you go there with me?

[Post-Chorus: Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
With me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
With me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you go there with me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
