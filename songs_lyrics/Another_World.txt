Another World
[Verse 1: Liam]
It's not me, it's not you, there's a reason
I'm just tryna read the signals I'm receivin'
Just like a stone on fire, can you feel it?
I don't know about you, girl, but I believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life

[Chorus: All]
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Everyday, in every way, oh-oh-oh
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

[Verse 2: Zayn]
One for me, one for you, whatcha doin'?
Girl, the music sounds so good when you're movin'
Let me take you higher, let me prove it
'Cause, hey, hey, pretty girl, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life
