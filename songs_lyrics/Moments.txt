Moments
[Verse 1: Liam]
Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Verse 2: Niall & Harry, Niall, Harry, Louis]
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky (Ah-ah-ah)
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Bridge: Zayn]
Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment in time (Time)
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be (Your reason to be) my love, my heart
Is breathing for this (Is breathing for this) moment in time
I'll find the words to say (To say) before you leave me today, yeah
