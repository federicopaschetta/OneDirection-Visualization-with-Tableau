Half The World Away
[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
If you were a good friend
You'd always be there when I needed
'Cause I'm on my knees and, babe, I'm bleeding
And it kills me that you're not around

[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
So you're not my girlfriend
Don't pretend that makes us nothing
Tell me you don't miss this feelin'
I'm starting to see who you are

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
'Cause there's a time, there's a place
And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm gonna sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same
'Cause you're half the world away

[Verse 3: Harry Styles]
A story you'd heard
Now you rest everything on these three words
Now I walk to you 'til my feet hurt
So tell me that's not good enough

And I started drinking
I don't know half of what I'm thinking
And deep in, I'm scared I'll stop breathing
We've started to lose who we are

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
'Cause there's a time, there's a place
And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm gonna to sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same

[Bridge: Harry Styles]
I want you around, 'round, 'round
Are we going down, down, down?
I want you around, 'round, 'round
Are we going down, down, down?
I want you around, 'round, 'round
Are we going down, down, down?
Are we going down, down (Down)?

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
'Cause there's a time, there's a place
And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm gonna sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same
('Cause you're half the world away)
There's a time, there's a place
And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm gonna sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same
'Cause you're half the world away
