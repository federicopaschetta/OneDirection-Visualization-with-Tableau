Same Mistakes
[Verse 1: Harry]
Circles, we're going in circles, dizzy's all it makes us
We know where it takes us, we've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer, there's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blamin' each other

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

[Chorus: All]
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

[Verse 2: Liam]
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this, we can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer, stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes

[Bridge: Liam]
Don't look back
But if we don't look back
We're only learning then
How to make all the same misâ€”
Same mistakes again

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Liam]
So we play, play, play all the same old games (The same mistakes)
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change (When nothing's gonna change)
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same (But nothing's gonna be the same)
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is (Crazy is)
When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix (There's nothing to fix)
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay (Oh, oh; That everything will be okay)
While you're making all the same mistakes
