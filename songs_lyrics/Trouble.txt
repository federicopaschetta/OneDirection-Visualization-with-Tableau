Trouble
[Verse 1]
Listen to the song I wrote
And all these notes I put them there for you
I still taste the time we kissed
Upon my lips, swimming in the blue

It never snows in Hollywood
But when we sang it showed us that it could
I carried you across the way
And you showed me that thirteen can be good

[Pre-Chorus]
You flipped me upside down
We’re both laying on the ground
And I don’t even know you
But I feel like I do sometimes
Looking in your eyes
When I see that smile therе’s trouble

[Chorus]
So turn around
And I'll hold my hands up
You know i’m trouble
I’m trouble with you

[Verse 2]
If I could havе a hundred things
Not one of them could compare to you
And we could take this anywhere
Cause were we’re going
We don’t need no shoes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You flip me upside down
We’re both laying on the ground
And I don’t even know you
But I feel like I do sometimes
Looking in your eyes
When I see the smile there’s trouble

[Chorus]
So turn around
And I'll hold my hands up
You know i’m trouble

[Bridge]
And you know that i’ll be gone in the morning
And I hope that you'll think of me like
I think of you all the time
Looking in your eyes when I see that smile there’s trouble

[Chorus]
So turn around
And I'll hold my hands up
You know i’m trouble
(You know i’m trouble)
But I feel like I do sometimes
Looking in your eyes when I see that smile (See that smile)
There’s trouble
So turn around
And I'll hold my hands up
You know i’m trouble
I’m trouble with you
