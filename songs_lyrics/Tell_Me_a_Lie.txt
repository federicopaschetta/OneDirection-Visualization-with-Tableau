Tell Me a Lie
[Verse 1: Liam, Zayn]
Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try, and I've tried
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives and I'm tired

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
As you break my heart again this time

[Chorus: All, Liam]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

[Verse 2: Liam, Harry]
Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye gets me every time
And, well, there must've been a time
I was the reason for that smile, so keep in mind

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
As you take what's left of you and I
You might also like[Chorus: All, Liam]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

[Bridge: Zayn]
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

[Chorus: Zayn, All, Liam]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen (Listen)
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight (Me tonight)
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

[Outro: Zayn, Liam]
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
