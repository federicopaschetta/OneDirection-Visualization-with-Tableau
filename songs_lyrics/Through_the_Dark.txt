Through the Dark
[Verse 1: Liam]
You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hidin'
And I just wanna see ya
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way
Through the dark

[Verse 2: Zayn, Louis]
I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold ya
You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughin'
So let's just laugh again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
Back to you

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way
Through the dark

[Bridge: Zayn]
And you don't need, you don't need to worry
And you will see, it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved

[Breakdown: Liam]
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love

[Chorus: All, Harry, Zayn]
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way
Through the dark
Oh, I will carry you over (Oh, I would, oh, I would)
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way
Through the dark
