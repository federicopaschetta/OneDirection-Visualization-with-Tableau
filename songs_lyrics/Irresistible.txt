Irresistible
[Verse 1: Harry]
Don't try to make me stay or ask if I'm okay
I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

[Chorus: Zayn]
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible

[Verse 2: Niall, Harry]
I've tried to ask myself, should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer
But I know, if I go now, if I leave, then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down, down, down, that's why
You might also like[Chorus: Zayn]
I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible

[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn]
Irresistible (Irresistible)
Irresistible (Irresistible)
Irresistible (Irresistible)
Irresistible

[Bridge: Harry]
It's in your lips and in your kiss
It's in your touch and your fingertips
And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are
And your eyes, irresistible

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Louis, Liam]
It makes your lips so kissable (Oh)
And your kiss unmissable (Oh)
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes
(Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes)
Irresistible
