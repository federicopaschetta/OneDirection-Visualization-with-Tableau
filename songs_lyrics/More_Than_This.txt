More Than This
[Intro: Liam]
Ooh

[Verse 1: Liam]
I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing alone, I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

[Chorus: Harry & Niall, Harry]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this

[Verse 2: Niall, Niall & Liam]
If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same, you save me
But when you leave, it's gone again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees, praying

[Chorus: All, Harry]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

[Bridge: Zayn, Zayn & Liam, All, Liam]
Yeah
I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms (Ooh)
And as you close your eyes tonight (Ooh)
I pray that you will see the light (Ooh)
That's shining from the stars above
And I say

[Breakdown: Liam, Zayn]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
('Cause I can love you more than this, yeah)
[Chorus: All, Harry, Zayn, Liam]
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight (Holds you close tonight)
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this (Yeah), yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside (I'm broken)
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
