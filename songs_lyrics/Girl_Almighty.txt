Girl Almighty
[Intro: Liam]
Hey, hey
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse: Liam, Harry]
Her light is as loud as, as many ambulances
As it takes to save a saviour, oh, woah, woah, woah
Now, she floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she's such a fake, that her love is made up, no, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightnin'

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Am I the only, only believer?
There, there's something happening here
There's something happening here
The only, only believer
There, there's something happening here
I hope you feel what I'm feeling, too

[Post-Chorus: Liam]
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees for ya
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you
