Na Na Na
[Verse 1: Liam, Zayn, Liam & Harry]
We've got a bit of love-hate
You take me to the edge, then you hit the brakes
I, I say it's over one day
But then I'm crawling back, begging you to stay
We make up and we breakup all the time (Ayy)
I'll say that I hate a song
Then you'll go request it the whole night long
S-some people say it's so wrong
But even when we fight, girl, you turn me on
We make up and we breakup all the time

[Chorus: Harry, All, Zayn]
We're like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Always like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right
We go, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na (Na-na-na)

[Verse 2: Liam & Niall, Liam & Harry]
You wanna party till late
But when I do the same, all you do is complain
Y-you know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you, girl, you make it okay
We make up and we break up all the time

We're like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Always like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right
We go, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na (Na-na-na)

[Bridge: All, Zayn]
Na, na, na (Ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah)
Na, na, na (Ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah)
Oh, woah
It drives me mad, oh

[Builtup: All]
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus: All, Zayn]
We're like, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yeah, yeah)
Always like, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yeah, yeah)
We're like, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yeah, yeah)
Always like, "Na-na-na" (Na-na-na)
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Oh, woah)
No, we can't make up our minds (Our minds)
'Cause when we think we've got it right (Right)
We go, "Na-na-na"
