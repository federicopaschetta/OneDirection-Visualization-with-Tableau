Stand Up
[Verse 1: Liam, Harry, Niall]
From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine (Take you and make you mine)
I would walk through the desert, I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine (Whatever it takes is fine)

[Chorus: All, Harry & Niall]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin'
Every piece of your heart, every piece of your heart

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
I know your heart's been broken, but don't you give up
I'll be there, yeah, I know it, to fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried (You've ever cried)

[Chorus: All, Harry & Niall]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin'
Every piece of your heart, every piece of your heart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin'
Every piece of your heart
You might also like[Bridge: Zayn]
Then I will steal us a car
And we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon, it's the least I can do
If you give me the chance

[Breakdown: All, Niall]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up

[Post-Chorus: All, Harry]
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (You can call me a thief)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (But you should know your part)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (I'm only here)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (Because you stole my heart)

[Chorus: All, Harry & Niall, Zayn]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin' (I won't be leaving)
Every piece of your heart, every piece of your heart
'Cause you stole my heart
[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn]
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (Call me a thief)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (But you should know your part)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief (I'm only here)
I'm a thief, I'm a thief ('Cause you stole my heart)
