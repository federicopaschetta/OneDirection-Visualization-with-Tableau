[Verse 1: Harry, All]
B-B-B-Baby, c'mon over
I don't care if people find out

They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)

[Pre-Chorus: Liam, All]
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
(Da-da, da-da-da) I can't hold back

[Chorus: All]
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic

So le-le-let them take the pictures
