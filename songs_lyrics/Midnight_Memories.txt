Midnight Memories
[Intro: Harry]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Harry]
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Ow, big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh, but we don't listen

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

[Chorus: All]
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2: Liam & Niall]
Five foot somethin' with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm findin' my way
Same old shh, but a different day
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

[Chorus: All]
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

[Bridge: Niall & Harry]
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight, let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop, so give me more, 'ore, ow!

[Chorus: All & Zayn]
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Baby, you and me (Me) stumblin' in the street (Street)
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Anywhere we go (Go), never say no (No)
Just do it, do it, do it, do it (Do it, do it, do it)
