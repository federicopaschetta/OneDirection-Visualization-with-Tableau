Stockholm Syndrome
[Verse 1: Harry, Zayn]
Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you

[Chorus: All]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Louis, All, Niall]
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? (Oh-oh-oh)
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind (Oh-oh-oh)
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[Chorus: All]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

All my life, I've been on my own (Oh-oh-oh)
I used the light to guide me home (Oh-oh-oh)
But now together we're alone (Oh-oh-oh)
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

[Breakdown: All, Harry]
(Look what you've done to me)
Baby, look what you've done

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done (Done) now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)
(Look what you've done to me, baby)
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down
(Look what you've done to me, baby)
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

[Outro: All]
(Look what you've done to me, baby)
Oh, baby, look what you've done
(Look what you've done to me, baby)
(Oh-oh-oh) Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
(Look what you've done to me, baby)
