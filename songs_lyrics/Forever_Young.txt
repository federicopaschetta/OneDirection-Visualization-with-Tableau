Forever Young
[Verse 1: Liam & Harry]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: All]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever, forever young?

[Verse 2: Niall & Harry]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
But sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
You might also like[Chorus: All]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young, forever
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?

[Bridge: Liam]
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

[Chorus: Harry & All]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young, forever
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever, forever young?
