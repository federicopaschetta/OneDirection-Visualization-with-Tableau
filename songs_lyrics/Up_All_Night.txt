Up All Night
[Verse 1: Liam, Niall]
It feels like we've been living in fast forward
Another moment passing by (Up, up, up all night)
The party's ending, but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight (Up, up, up all night)

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way, yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

[Chorus: Harry, All]
I wanna stay
Up all night and jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you

[Post-Chorus: All]
Up, up, up all night like this, all night (Hey)
Up all night like this, all night (Hey)
Up all night

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall]
Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh (Up, up, up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back (Up, up, up all night)
