Clouds
[Intro: All]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)

[Verse 1: Harry, Louis]
I know you say that you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never, ever simple, no
Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
If we're never comin' back down
Yeah, we're lookin' down on the clouds

[Post-Chorus: All]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I know you said that you don't like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
Well, love is always, always changing, woah
But someday, you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
If we're never comin' back down
Yeah, we're lookin' down on the clouds

[Bridge: Niall, Harry]
And we go, and we go, and we go, and we don't stop (Clouds)
No, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't ever grow up (Clouds)
And we go, and we go, and we go, and we don't stop (Clouds)
No, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't ever grow up

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Niall]
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end? (Here we go again)
(And we go, and we go, and we go, and we don't stop)
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends (Here we go again)
(No, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't ever grow up)
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again (Here we go again)
(And we go, and we go, and we go, and we don't stop)
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end? (Here we go again)
