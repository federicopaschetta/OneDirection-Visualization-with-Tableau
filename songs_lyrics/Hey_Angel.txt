We look up to the sky?

Do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past?
Hey angel

To come to the other side?

Tell me, do you ever cry
When we waste away our lives?

[Bridge: Liam, Liam & Louis]
Yeah, I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
