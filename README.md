# One Direction Data Visualization with Tableau

## Overview
This project dives deep in the world of One Direction boy-band. It includes data collection via web scraping 

## Contents
- Deep_Learning___Report.pdf: Contains the comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, experiments, results, and analysis of the object recognition project.
- DeepLearningAssignment.pdf: Provides the project assignment and objectives that were addressed throughout the course of this research.
- Architectures: Directory containing different model architectures used in the project:
  - ffNN: Implementations and experiments using feedforward neural networks.
  - CNN: Notebooks and resources related to convolutional neural networks.
  - tLearning: Application of transfer learning methods.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks contained within each architecture's folder. The notebooks are self-contained and include comments explaining each step of the process.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
Running the Notebooks
To run the notebooks, navigate to the specific architecture directory in your terminal and launch Jupyter Notebook:

cd path_to_directory
jupyter notebook
